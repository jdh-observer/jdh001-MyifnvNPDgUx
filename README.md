## Abstract

The role of European social democracy in the origins of the Cold War is a key question for its history and has a rich literature. However, combining digital history with transnational approach can still produce new insights. The rarely explored Socialist International offers the best opportunity to experiment with new tools. This article explores the political culture of European social democracy at the beginning of the Cold War by analysing the debates inside the Socialist International to define a socialist identity. The organisation, to which most European socialists belonged, allowed them to coordinate their activities and reach an agreement on ideas and strategy through debate. For this purpose, the Socialist International published a journal in the late 1940s and a book in the early 1950s, to which most parties contributed articles or chapters. These collections are representative of the political culture of European social democracy at the time, so they provide a great opportunity to analyse transnational debates. In the era of mass parties, examining the ideology of few great thinkers or top leaders is not enough; political culture is better expressed by myriads of speeches and articles produced by low-ranking party officials and journalists. A comprehensive analysis is beyond traditional textual analysis, but digital history is particularly suited for this purpose, as quantitative text analysis can reveal hidden similarities and underlying tensions within social democratic culture. This article relies on new data specifically digitised for this article: the texts produced by the Socialist International for the large public from the late 1940s to the mid-1950s. While it is a small corpus, it is comprehensive and representative of most social democratic parties across Europe. The possibility of combining close and distant reading allows to test which instruments of corpus linguistics are best suited to study political culture of mass movements. This article employs topic modeling to reveal not just what were the main interests and concerns of social democrats at the time, but also differences among parties and the existence of subgroups within the socialist family. The results will allow to enrich the narrative of how European social democracy acted at the beginning of the Cold War, from the descent of the Iron Curtain, to the intense bipolar tension to the first steps in decolonisation and European integration.
